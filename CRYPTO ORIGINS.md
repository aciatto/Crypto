# CRYPTO ORIGINS

The purpose of this file will be to present the origins of cryptocurrency. 
By first gaining an appreciation for the technology, the following research project will be more interesting.

*Cracks knuckles to begin typing*

Two factors led to the birth of cryptocurrency: The Internet and 2008.

In the early 90s, the Internt surged in popularity. This was a period known as the "Dot com" era as anyone with a website could raise large sums of money as they spoke of a digital society where all problems could be solved online. Sound like an emerging technology today? Anyway, in addition to the websites themselves,entrepreneuers were excited about building a payment system that was native to the Internet. Paypal emerged and was great, but it still has to go through traditional financial intermediaries. True technologists wanted something that was created, owned, transferred, and stored completely online.

They wanted digital money.

The problem that these folks kept running into was the "double-spending" problem. Imagine three people, Alice, Bob, and Carl. If Alice has 5 digital dollars, it was seemingly impossible to stop Alice from making a copy of her digital money and sending 5 to Bob and 5 to Carl. It was the problem any Internet site was running into with illegal file sharing. This double-spending problem was frustrating, so many people gave up on the idea of digital money, but others continued to think about the issue.

Flash forward to 2008.

The world economy was crumbling in large part from the poor decisions made by leaders of global financial institutions, especially big Wall Street banks. Even if your money was not directly invested with one of these banks or its affiliates, countless people were affected by unemployment, falling stock prices, and depreciating home values. The U.S. government and others deemed these banks as vital to our economy, and did everything in their power to save them. In other words, the government decided that these institutions were "Too Big To Fail". 

There are two points of view that emerged following the crisis.

(1) The government was wise to step in and apply stimulus as it prevented even further damage.

(2) The government propped up businesses that would not learn from their mistakes, and are raising taxes and national debt to save these banks. In 2018, the economy looks strong, but fears of the debt, trade wars, and other macroeconomic concerns remain. The Federal Reserve has slowly raised rates to 1.5% since it slashed them from 4% to 0% back in 2008-2010, but if the economy crashes in the next couple of years, what other tools are available? Cutting rates from where they are to 0% might not be enough. There were a number of people that were dissatisfied with what Wall Street created and how the Federal Reserve responded with quantitative easing and the ensuing debt. Some people were EXTREMELY frustrated with how the Fed handled this process, and became paranoid that the Fed will print too much money and erode the value of the U.S. Dollar. The distrust of centralized financial institutions was growing.

Flash forward to January 2009.

A nine-page white paper was published online titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". The author, operating under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto", announced that he had created "a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority".

It seemed almost too good to be true.

For decades technologists grappled with the double-spending problem preventing the adoption of digital cash. Meanwhile, others were increasingly aware of the risks of centralized financial institutions. Satoshi addressed both of these issues in just nine pages.

So what did Satoshi actually create?

He created two things: (1) A currency native to the Internet that had solved the double-spending problem. This invention was called "cryptocurrency". (2) Second, he created a decentralized system to govern the currency rather than trusting one central group to watch over the money supply (e.g. Federal Reserve). This investion was called the "Blockchain".

In otherwords a cryptocurrency is a digital money that solved the double-spending problem using the Blockchain rather than a central intermediary. To send money over the Internet, you traditionally had a middleman like Venmo that ensured Alice had enough money to pay Bob. Once Alice sent $5, Venmo deducted $5 from Alice's account and adedd $5 to Bob's. You have to trust that Venmo will act as a neutral third-party in this case. The blockchain was cleverly designed to remove the need for trust. 

Let's look at the same Alice-Bob transaction except using the blockchain rather than Venmo.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions that everyone can see. It is basically like Google Sheets. In the original block, Alice has $5 and Bob has $0. Alice sends Bob $5. A few steps happen. The blockchain validators, called "miners", check to see if Alice has $5 in her account. She does. Then they record a decrease of $5 for Alice and an increase for Bob. Thousands of miners now have a record of Alice sending the money and her new balance is $0. Thinking back to the earlier example, what if Alice tried to send $5 to Carl after Bob? Well, she would try, but the miners would look  at the history of the blockchain and see that Alice has $0 so the transaction would fail. What if Alice her malicious? What if in the original transaction she had paid some miners to state that her balance was $5 so she could also double-spend and pay Carl? Well, when miners have different opinions on what the balances should be, it is put to a vote. Alice would need 51% of the miners to say that she still has $5. This is virtually impossible to do. Alice would have to convince 51% of the thousands of miners to act dishonestly which is very impractical and shows how sufficiently decentralized blockchains resist 51% attacks. Miner's agreement on Alice's true balance is what is meant by decentralized consensus.

That is the beauty of cryptocurrency and the blockchain. It uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending, and
it's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.

In addition to verifying transactions, Satoshi created a system to carefully regulate the supply of Bitcoins. As previously
mentioned, there are people very much concerned about inflation in their countries. They have little control over the money
supply and could easily see their wealth destroyed by rampant inflation (e.g. Venezuela). Satoshi proposed a careful "reward schedule" that baked moderate inflation into the ecosystem, but would not allow a central entity to print more money
than what was originally planned.

Minders are incentivized to honestly verify transactions, because if they do, they have a chance to receive a reward of Bitcoin. This mining process is how new Bitcoins are brought into existence. A block of transactions is mined/confirmed every ten minutes. Among the miners that helped confirm the block, one is selected to receive a Bitcoin reward. The reward used to be 50 BTC/block, but has been halved to 25 and again to 12.5. In a graph of supply versus time, the function approaches the asymptote of the "final" amount of BTC that will be in circulation, 21 million coins.


This document could proceed endlessly, but I think that it is important to leave more of the story up for discovery. It is time to go into the world and learn more about this emerging field and make sense of the chaos through careful analysis. 

There are many many many people that don't think cryptocurrency will catch on and it's just a scam. I encourage you to read the Bitcoin white paper in the repository. I do not believe it is a scam. It is simply the presentation of a very interesting experiment. An experiment that has almost died many times but has repeatedly returned stronger than before.

If I wanted to be extreme and say that people are underestimating crypto I'd say something like this...

"At first they'll say it's impossible, then they'll say it's inevitable"
